## Overview
As the coordinator of schooling department, I have supported and encouraged new ideas from the volunteers and executive 
committee members team. As a team, we have revamped the 74 volunteer's department with the introduction of a new 
efficient 'class heads system' enhancing from the existing 'team heads system' after through analysis. This new system 
has brought a synergy in functioning of the school by  closely linking the class heads with students, volunteers of class
Additionally, we have added new initiatives of Nav gurukul program which was huge success as two of our students were
selected for the Gurukul program i.e. these under privilege students will now have free education at top institute and
