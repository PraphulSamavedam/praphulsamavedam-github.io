## Overview:
As the publicity coordinator in the student chapter for the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
at the Pilani campus of BITS-Pilani, I have designed posters and marketed the events, workshops of IEEE across campus.
I have spearheaded the publicity team for carrying out marketing campaign for the IEEE events especially for the 
Track-o-mania and PlAI events in APOGEE.    
In the PlAI (Play with AI) event, two teams (tank representing team with limited bullets) compete to defeat opponent team in an 
autonomous fashion by scoring a higher damage to the opponent team.
In the Track-o-mania, teams compete in solving a maze the quickest using an autonomous line-following robot using only sensors.
