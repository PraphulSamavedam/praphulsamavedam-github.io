## Overview
I have served as joint coordinator in the technical fest A Professions Oriented Gathering over Educational Experiences (APOGEE) for the Electrical and  Electronics Engineers Association (EEEAssoc). 
As a joint coordinator, I have played pivotal role in the conduction of 2 kernel events i.e. i-Strike and Robots At War (RAW).
In the i-Strike event, a computer controlled robot moves on a possible path with no obstructions collecting all treasures and visiting an island based on computer vision with feed from camera mounted on the top providing complete view of the maze.
In RAW event, teams compete in a knock-out tournament fashion for top 3 positions.

For both the events, our team has carried out complete event conduction starting from participant registration to results celebrations.
