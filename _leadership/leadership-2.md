## Overview
I have served as joint coordinator in the technical fest A Professions Oriented Gathering over Educational Experiences (APOGEE) for the Electrical and  Electronics Engineers Association (EEEAssoc). 
As a joint coordinator, I have played pivotal role in the conduction of 2 kernel events i.e. i-Strike and Robots At War (RAW). 
In I-Strike event, robots solve the maze autonomously using computer vision with camera mounted on the top providing complete view of the maze.
In RAW event, teams compete in a knock-out tournament fashion for top 3 positions. For both the events, our team has carried out complete event conduction starting from participant registration to results celebrations.
We have also conducted arduino based workshops to increase th participation in the events.
