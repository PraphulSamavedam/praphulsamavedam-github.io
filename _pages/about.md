## Summary

I am currently interning as an AI/ML Co-op at an innovative no code AI startup 'Sway AI' in US while pursuing 
my masters in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Khoury College of computer sciences, Northeastern University.   

I possess almost 4 years of experience working in cross-functional teams, utilizing Agile methodologies at Nvidia, UBS, 
BNY Mellon, and PensioTech in different capacities ranging from an intern to data scientist positions collaborating 
with senior management members.  

In my professional journey, I have acquired several soft skills such as interpersonal, collaboration, and 
communication skills that enable me to coordinate with other teams, build a rapport with them, and 
communicate findings with stakeholders. I have also achieved success in various competitions, securing 
**1<i><sup>st</sup></i>** position in UBS's Superstars event under the AI category, which played a pivotal role in 
securing the runner-up position for my team. Additionally, I have secured <b>5<i><sup>th</sup></i></b> and 
<b>14<sup><i>th</i></sup></b> positions at competitive hackathons Datathon and Job-a-thon hosted on Kaggle 
and Analytics Vidya.

My undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at India's top private university 
BITS-Pilani, Pilani campus have given me a strong foundation in hardware, which I believe will be beneficial in 
developing the best products that have software perfectly optimized with underlying hardware. So I strongly believe that 
we have a strong background in both software and hardware through my educational and professional journey.

One of my key accomplishments has been my work on automating tasks, which has heavily benefited my previous employers. 
By leveraging my technical skills and knowledge of artificial intelligence, I was able to develop solutions that 
streamlined processes and increased efficiency.

Overall, I am a highly motivated, daring individual with a passion for artificial intelligence and a strong desire to 
have a challenging career with positive impact in the field. My diverse skill set and experiences make me an ideal 
candidate for any organization looking to innovate and grow.
