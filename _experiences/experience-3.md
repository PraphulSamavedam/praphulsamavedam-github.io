Not only does his character and personality shine through, he also proved himself to be more than capable of his job and have exceeded expectations. This is one of the reason he got promoted within couple of years to next level.
Praphul has a firm grasp of technical details and he never shy away to learn different technologies.

I had the privilege of working with Praphul as his immediate supervisor while delivering analytics solutions for internal clients within UBS. There were times when going got tough and Praphul was my preferred resort to manage the situation."
