## Overview
In the CPU validation team, I was responsible for maintaining the internal ARM simulator to support the newly added 
features in ARM v8.x for their next chip to be ARM compliant. I have designed and executed the test plan for the features of 
Reliability, and Serviceability (R.A.S). This was my hands of experience in carrying out bare-metal tests, with hypervisor
and presenting the summarized results to the CPU wing team.

### Achievements:
- Attained 90% test coverage via design and implementation of bare metal test plan in assembly language for features.
- Improved system performance close to 3% by triaging existing prioritized bugs.
