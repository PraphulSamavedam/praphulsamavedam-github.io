## Overview
As a control specialist, I was responsible in developing the control analytics reports to the senior risk management
executives. The control analytics report compromised of the monthly compliance reports at regional levels 
i.e. Asia and Pacific (APAC), Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), North, Central, and South America
(AMER) and at global (Global) levels.  
  
Initially I had worked on the manual process based on Excel for this report generation, later I had automated the 
process using Python. I had conducted a session on my solution and its potential extensions with chatbot for custom 
reporting.
