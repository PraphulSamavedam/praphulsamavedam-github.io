## Overview
Aim was to develop a simulation software for users to experiment different investment strategies such as dollar cost 
averaging with various portfolios without involving money but with real value of the stocks. 
For obtaining the real value of stocks, we have integrated the premium version of the Alpha Vantage API. Our solution 
was developed with model-view-controller (MVC) architecture following SOLID principles in an incremental fashion with 
4 iterations on the product. This project was the first time, where I have integrated API and used cache for reducing 
the number of API calls for significant reduction in cost. Our final product allowed user to interact in both graphical
and command line styles, persist portfolios among sessions, keep placeholders for future purchase orders, understand 
cost basis of portfolio, portfolio composition, etc.
