title: "Energy Harvesting, Hybrid, Cooperative Wireless System Modeling and Outage Performance Analysis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-1
excerpt: 'This paper is about Hybrid coperative wireless system consisting of analog and digital link with energy
 harvesting relay nodes. Relay nodes harvest energy for small \tau fraction and uses this harvested energy to process
 the input signal and relay to next node. This papers focusses on closed loop form of outage probability of these
  hybrid energy harvesting systems in the presence of various noises and purports the usage of 2 signal
   enhancement techniques: Pre-Emphashis (PE) and De-Emphasis (DE) for lowering the outage probability'
