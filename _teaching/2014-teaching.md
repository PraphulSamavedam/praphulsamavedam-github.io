Fond of teaching, I had joined the schooling department of National service scheme and opted to teach for class of 7
<sup>th</sup> in my first year intentionally so that I can teach them till their 10<sup>th</sup> class
 through all my 4 years of undergraduate studies at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS-Pilani).I 
  have taught mathematics, science subjects for the students of class 7<sup>th</sup>. The average of student's marks
 improved by nearly 2%. This first chance provided me the opportunity to teach, set paper and grade nearly 60 students.
