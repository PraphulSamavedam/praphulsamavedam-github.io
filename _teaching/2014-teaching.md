Fond of teaching, I had joined the schooling department of National service scheme and opted to teach for 7
<sup>th</sup> class in my first year intentionally so that I can teach them till their 10<sup>th</sup> class
 throughout all my 4 years of undergraduate studies at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS-Pilani).I 
 have taught mathematics, science subjects for them. The average of student's marks improved by nearly 2%. 
This first chance provided me the opportunity to teach, set paper and grade nearly 60 students.
