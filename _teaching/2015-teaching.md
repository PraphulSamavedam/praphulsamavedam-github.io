Based on my dedication to teach kids and my engagement with kids, I was promoted to the position of executive
 committee member in this year. Despite the additional responsibility of an executive committee member, I continued
  to teach my set of students in class 8th on their weak subjects. Through this, I had learned  management
   skills of both time and work which were beneficial in my corporate life.
