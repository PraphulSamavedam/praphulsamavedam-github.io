This year I was promoted to the highest level in the schooling department as the 'School Co-ordinator'. Apart from
 this responsibility, I had taught for the 9<sup>th</sup> class. This year we had initiated focus on
  scholarship opportunities for the children and I am glad to say that *3* of our students were selected for Navodaya
   scholarship. My students have shown an average improvement of nearly 5% in their overall exam's scores.
